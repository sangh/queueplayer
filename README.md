Don't Use This
==============

Don't use this silly little music player, there are way better ones available.


Queue Player
============

I once needed a way to flexibly play files on the command line (without X
running) and have them queue up in the background.  Being young, dumb, and full
of pride I wrote this instead of using any of the existing ones.

It developed what you see here.

There is extensive help in the 'q' file so I won't copy it here.
